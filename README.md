## Introduction

Bimacoin is a digital currency (also called crypto-currency) that is not backed by any country's central bank or government. Bimacoins can be traded for goods or services with vendors who accept Bimacoins as payment.

Bimacoin-to-Bimacoin transactions are made by digitally exchanging anonymous, heavily encrypted hash codes across a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The P2P network monitors and verifies the transfer of Bimacoins between users. Each user's Bimacoins are stored in a program called a digital wallet, which also holds each address the user sends and receives Bitcoins from, as well as a private key known only to the user.
