## Introduction

Bimacoin is a digital currency (also called crypto-currency) that is not backed by any country's central bank or government. Bimacoins can be traded for goods or services with vendors who accept Bimacoins as payment.

Bimacoin-to-Bimacoin transactions are made by digitally exchanging anonymous, heavily encrypted hash codes across a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The P2P network monitors and verifies the transfer of Bimacoins between users. Each user's Bimacoins are stored in a program called a digital wallet, which also holds each address the user sends and receives Bitcoins from, as well as a private key known only to the user.

## Etymology

The term "Bima" comes from the wayang play which tells the story of a Javanese and Balinese God, Ruci. Although not the original part of the main story in wayang, this story is very popular in Javanese and Balinese society and is performed by many puppeteers in Java.

In the story, the Bima character who is also called Werkodara fights with a dragon snake named Nabatnawa. The dragon managed to wrap Bima, and the dragon thought he would die. But Bima remembered his Pancanaka nails and stabbed them into the dragon's body. The dragon died, and Bima became free.

According to legend, the shadow of the Bima figure wrapped around Nabatnawa rose into the sky and became a bright latitude in the night sky called the 'Bima Sakti' (Milky Way).
